Filtering in the Frequency Domain

Task #01
Implement the following Low Pass Filters
i. Ideal LPF
ii. Butterworth LPF
iii. Gaussian LPF

Task #02
Convert the Low Pass Filters above to High Pass Filters
i. Ideal HPF
ii. Butterworth HPF
iii. Gaussian HPF

Analyze all the filters with outputs. Use images from Chapter 4.
Discuss on the outputs obtained by changing different parameters, such as cut-off frequency, order, etc.
