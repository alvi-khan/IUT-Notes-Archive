Task #1
(a) Write a function that takes a grayscale image as argument and generates the histogram of that grayscale image. You can use any suitable grayscale image from here: https://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIP-3E/dip3e_book_images_downloads.htm.

(b) Take any suitable color image and divide it into 3 separate channels. Display the individual channels in their own color. For example, the red channel should generate a red image, where the intensity of red in each pixel will depend on how much red is present in that pixel in the original color image.

(c) Use your previously written histogram function from Task 1(a) to generate the histogram of color image. Since color images have 3 channels, so you will have 3 histograms. Analyze the histograms to determine which color is more dominant in the image.

Task#2
(a) Write a function that takes an grayscale image as argument and returns the negative of that image. g(x,y) = Lmax - f(x,y) ; where Lmax=255 for 8-bit image.
	
(b) Extend your function so that it works for color images too.
