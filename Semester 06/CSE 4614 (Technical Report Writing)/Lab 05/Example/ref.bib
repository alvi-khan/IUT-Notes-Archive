abstract = {Automatic facial expression analysis is an interesting and challenging problem, and impacts important applications in many areas such as humanâ€“computer interaction and data-driven animation. Deriving an effective facial representation from original face images is a vital step for successful facial expression recognition. In this paper, we empirically evaluate facial representation based on statistical local features, Local Binary Patterns, for person-independent facial expression recognition. Different machine learning methods are systematically examined on several databases. Extensive experiments illustrate that LBP features are effective and efficient for facial expression recognition. We further formulate Boosted-LBP to extract the most discriminant LBP features, and the best recognition performance is obtained by using Support Vector Machine classifiers with Boosted-LBP features. Moreover, we investigate LBP features for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which is a critical problem but seldom addressed in the existing work. We observe in our experiments that LBP features perform stably and robustly over a useful range of low resolutions of face images, and yield promising performance in compressed low-resolution video sequences captured in real-world environments.}
