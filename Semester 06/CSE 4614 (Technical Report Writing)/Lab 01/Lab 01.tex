\maketitle

We can send the rest of the text to a new page like this.

\newpage

We can make text bold like \textbf{this}.

We can make text italic like \textit{this}.

We can underline text like \underline{this}.

We can emphasise text like \emph{this}.

The difference between emphasis and plain old italics is that emphasis is content-aware. Basically, if we have \textit{a bunch of italic text like this and we add \textit{another layer of italic} in between, there is no difference.} But if we have \textit{italic text inside which we place \emph{emphasised text}, the emphasised text is non-italised.}
